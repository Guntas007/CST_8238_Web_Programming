	<h2>Define HTML.</h2>
	<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to create web pages.</p>
	
	<h2>Define Client-server model of communications.</h2>
	<p>The web is sometimes referred to as a client-server model of communications. Server is the agent who is active 24/7 listening to the client queries. Client is the agent who makes request to and gets response from the server.</p>
	
	<h2>Write down the name of different types of servers.</h2>
	<p>Data server, Application server, Authentication server, Email server, Web server, and Media server.</p>
	
	<h2>Define a Web Server</h2>
	<p>A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the WWW</p>
	
	<h2>Define Data Centers</h2>
	<p>Server farms are typically housed in special facilities called data centers.</p>
	
	<h2>Why do we need a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)?</h2>
	<p>We need a URL to uniquely identify a resource on WWW</p>
	
	<h2>Give an example of Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and specify all components of a URL.</h2>
	<p>URL example: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A2UeYe90SI" here 'https' is the 'Protocol', 'www.youtube.com' is the 'Domain name', 'watch' is the 'Path', and '?v=6A2UeYe90SI' is the 'Query'.</p>
	
	<h2>What is the difference between a static and a dynamic web site?</h2>
	<p>In terms of the material displayed, a static webpage remains the same or fixed. A dynamic webpage, on the other hand, adjusts its content based on the user's location.</p>
	
	<h2>Why do we need Domain Name System (DNS)?</h2>
	<p>As elegant as IP addresses may be, human beings do not enjoy having to recall long strings of numbers, hence, instead of IP addresses, we use the Domain Name System (DNS)</p>
	
	<h2>Describe in detail the process of DNS address resolution?</h2>
	<p>While domain names provide a simpler method for users to refer to a website, a browser eventually needs to know the IP address of the website in order to request any resources from it. The DNS makes it possible for software to discover this numeric IP address. This is referred to as address resolving in this context.</p>
	
	<h2>Give some examples of generic top-Level domains (gTLD).</h2>
	<p>Some examples of gTLDs are: .com, .gov, .org, .net, etc. </p>
	
	<h2>Give some examples of country code top-Level domains (ccTLD).</h2>
	<p>Some examples of ccTLDs are: .in, .ca, .us, .au, .fr, etc.</p>
	
	<h2>How can you pass a user&rsquo;s information from the client to the web server?</h2>
	<p>The browser sends an HTTP Request to the server when you click a link on a web page, submit a form, or run a search.</p>
	
	<h2>What is the function (purpose) of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?</h2>
	<p>By default, the HTTP protocol establishes a TCP connection on port 80.</p>
	
	<h2>Describe how a single web page is displayed on a web browser.</h2>
	<p>The client's browser facilitates the experience of viewing a single web page by requesting the initial HTML page, then parsing the returned HTML to find all the resources referenced from within it, such as images, style sheets, and scripts. Only after all of the files have been retrieved is the page fully loaded for the user.</p>
	
	<h2>Give some examples of HTTP request methods.</h2>
	<p>Some examples of HTTP request methods are: GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, and OPTIONS</p>
